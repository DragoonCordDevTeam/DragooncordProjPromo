						<p>A sassy lunar sky dragon aiming straight for your heart. Selen Tatsuki is a top level
							competitive FPS player with an unforgettable laugh. Selen has a strong competitive spirit
							and a drive to win. She has a bratty personality and will tease everyone around her, but
							secretly has a softer side and cares deeply about her friends.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Selen is a member of Nijisanji EN's 2nd wave: Obsydia. She is a dragon racer that loves to
							win. First person shooters are Selen's games of choice, especially Apex Legends, but she
							keeps things fresh with games from other genres. Notable non shooter games Selen has played
							include retro RTS and platformer games, such as Starcraft: Brood War and the original Mega
							Man series. Despite her assertive personality, Selen's one weakness is horror, and her fans
							often revel in the "gap moe" of watching this dragon shriek in fear while playing horror
							games. This "gap moe" personality also comes up in more tender ways, like when she made an
							adorable rice bear bento box on stream. Selen's greatest strength as an entertainer is her
							ability to get along with other people. Selen frequently will collaborate with a variety of
							different guests, and no matter who she's with, those collaborations are always a treat to
							watch
